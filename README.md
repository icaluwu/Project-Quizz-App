##  Overview

A compact quiz web application developed as a **mini learning project** under the guidance of MySkill, mentored by **Alfi Nur Hakim** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Designed with core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to provide basic yet practical quiz functionality.

##  Project Structure
```
├── index.html — Main quiz interface
├── sign-up.html — Simple user sign-up page
├── app.js — JavaScript logic for quiz functionality
├── style.css — Styling for all pages
└── (other assets)
```


---

##  Features

- User sign-up interface (`sign-up.html`)
- Quiz flow handled via JavaScript in `app.js`
- Styled using modular CSS (`style.css`)
- Easy to extend into non-static variations (e.g., API-driven quizzes)

---

##  Technology Stack

- **HTML5** — Structure and layout  
- **CSS3** — Styling and responsive layout  
- **Plain JavaScript** — Interactivity and quiz logic

---

##  Usage & Deployment

- Clone the repository to your local machine.  
- Open `index.html` (or `sign-up.html` followed by `index.html`) in any modern browser.  
- For live preview:
  - **GitHub Pages**: Enable via `Settings → Pages`, choose `main` branch and root folder.  
  - **Netlify / Vercel**: Deploy static site with minimal configuration — no build required.

##  Learning Outcome

- Understood file-based user interface flow with a simple sign-up mechanism.
- Reinforced best practices organizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for lightweight projects.
- Enhanced readiness for extending projects with backend integrations or dynamic data sources.
